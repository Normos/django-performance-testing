separate data collection from reporting
---------------------------------------

* write and test serializer of results from signal
  * how to be sure that all result types can be used?
    introdcue a collector method to provide sample results
    - to be used in tests
    - could also be used by users to test their signal handlers/reports
    - each result is assumed to return a list of objects where each can
      be tested through standard == equality checks
  * serializer reading back should also just fire signal results_collected
    but should have a different name to avoid problems and to be explicit
* test that during thestrun, serializer is connected to the signal
* change worst_report to use the new signal
* assert worstreport/report is not subscribed to results_collected signal
* add deprecation warning for DJPT_SHOW_WORST_REPORT setting

* support multiple runs generating different files and combining them

* write bang_for_the_buck report on what to improve first 

---------------------------------------
use for template tags
rename limits settings to be consistent with the DJPT_ prefix
   add deprecation warning for old style
   should I also update the tests to run both versions?

future, out of scope now for registry
---------------------------------------
need to write settings_changed_handler too
use it for app ready integration points, simplifying integrate_** methods
    should use runtime value of settings
    focus on templates - can it be released w/out rewriting the integration?
        problably not - would be misleading, though depends on documentation
