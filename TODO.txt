separate data collection from reporting
---------------------------------------

* introduce a command to run/display reports and remove inlined one

* support multiple runs generating different files and combining them

* write bang_for_the_buck report on what to improve first 

---------------------------------------
use for template tags
rename limits settings to be consistent with the DJPT_ prefix
   add deprecation warning for old style
   should I also update the tests to run both versions?

future, out of scope now for registry
---------------------------------------
need to write settings_changed_handler too
use it for app ready integration points, simplifying integrate_** methods
    should use runtime value of settings
    focus on templates - can it be released w/out rewriting the integration?
        problably not - would be misleading, though depends on documentation
