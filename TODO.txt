use for template tags

future, out of scope now for registry
--------------------------------------
need to write settings_changed_handler too
use it for app ready integration points, simplifying integrate_** methods
    should use runtime value of settings
    focus on templates - can it be released w/out rewriting the integration?
        problably not - would be misleading, though depends on documentation
